abstract = {In the glasshouse cultivation of a long-season tomato crop, maximum fruit production is obtained when there is a proper balance between the demand and the supply of assimilate, and an optimum proportion of vegetative growth throughout the season in order to sustain the crop photosynthetic capacity. These aspects of crop growth are mainly affected by the fruit load, defined as the assimilate demand of all fruits together. In practice fruit load is controlled by plant density, fruit thinning and temperature. These measures for crop control can be more precise and effective if their effects are known in quantitative terms. An explanatory dynamic growth model was developed that simulates assimilate demand and dry matter distribution in an indeterminate tomato crop. Number of growing organs was evaluated through prediction of initiation, abortion and harvest of individual organs. Assimilate demand was based on potential organ growth rates (growth at nonlimiting assimilate supply). Dry matter distribution in the model was in proportion to the potential growth rates of the organs. In total 11 glasshouse experiments were conducted, six of which included temperature treatments. Truss formation rate increased with temperature (17-27°C) and declined with plant age. Truss formation rate was found to depend on the genotype, while fruit load, plant density, season and electrical conductivity of the root environment (EC: 0.3-0.9 S m -1) had no effect. The number of fruit that develop per truss was positively correlated with the vegetative growth of the top of the plants. The duration of the fruit growth period (time between anthesis and start of colouring) was shortened with increasing temperature, young and old fruits being the most sensitive. At the same air temperature the fruit growth period in summer was shorter than in spring. Fruits of old plants had slightly longer growth period than fruits of young plants. Potential weight of the fruits at harvest was negatively correlated with temperature, mainly due to the shorter fruit growth period. Further, the potential size increased with ontogeny, which effect was more pronounced in early than in late spring. The course of potential weight in time was described by a Gompertz growth curve exhibiting the maximum growth rate at about 40% of the fruit growth period. When during fruit development a fruit changed from limiting to nonlimiting assimilate supply, it did not immediately reach the same growth rate as fruits grown constantly at nonlimiting assimilate supply., A mechanism is proposed that explains this phenomenon. The fraction of dry matter distributed to vegetative growth declined substantially with temperature. The (apparent) potential growth rate of a vegetative unit at 24°C was estimated to be as much as 50% lower than at 19°C. The dry matter-content of fruits was negatively correlated with temperature and EC of the root environment and was higher in summer than in spring and autumn. The model was tested with data from five commercial crops. Truss formation rate, fruit growth period and dry matter distribution were predicted reasonably well. The modelling of the number of fruits per truss requires more investigation. Simulated assimilate demand of a mature tomato crop reached values of 10 and 60g CH 2 O m -2d -1for maintenance respiration and growth respectively. The potential growth rate (as defined by the sinks) appeared to be about twice the actual growth rate. A simulation study indicated that maximum fruit production of tomato is probably obtained at a fairly low leaf area index (2-3 m 2m -2). At supra-optimum leaf area index additional leaf area for extra light interception requires more assimilate than it would produce. Computations showed that in spring and early summer the optimum plant density is determined by the required number of fruits (sink capacity) whereas in summer a combination of high plant density and fruit thinning seems required for sufficient leaf area. The results are discussed with respect to the crop sink-source system and temperature control in the glasshouse. Prospects for practical applications of the model are presented.},

@article{Vanthoor2011,
abstract = {With the aim of developing a model-based method to design greenhouses for a broad range of climatic and economic conditions, a greenhouse climate model has been developed and validated. This model describes the effects of the outdoor climate and greenhouse design on the indoor greenhouse climate. For use in a greenhouse design method that focused on the optimisation of a set of design elements, the model should fulfil the following three requirements: 1) predict the temperature, vapour pressure and CO2 concentration of the greenhouse air, with sufficient accuracy for a wide variety of greenhouse designs under varying climate conditions, 2) include the commonly used greenhouse construction parameters and climate conditioning equipment, and 3) consist of a set of first order differential equations to ensure that it can be combined with a tomato yield model (of a similar structure) and to allow the use of ordinary differential equation solvers. The dynamic model was validated for four different greenhouse designs under three climatic conditions: a temperate marine climate, a Mediterranean climate and a semi-arid climate. For these conditions, the model accurately predicted the greenhouse climate for all four designs without modification of the model parameters (except for one case). In more than 78% of the cases, comparison of simulations and measurements of the indoor climate yielded a relative root mean square error of less than 10%. Given these results, the model is considered to be sufficiently accurate and sufficiently generic to be used for developing a model-based greenhouse design method. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

@article{Boulard1993,
abstract = {A greenhouse climate model, incorporating the effects of natural ventilation and evaporative cooling (fog-system), is proposed and discussed. Linearization of the greenhouse heat and water balance equations leads to a simple system of two equations with two unknowns (the temperature and humidity differences between inside and outside air) which represent quite well the complex coupling mechanisms between ventilation and fog observed in situ. The model predicts that a minimum inside temperature can be reached for a certain combination of these cooling processes. Crop temperature and transpiration were also estimated using the Penman-Monteith approach and the energy balance of the crop. Good agreement between measured and computed values of air temperature, air humidity, crop temperature and transpiration was observed. From a practical point of view this approach may permit improvement in on-line climate control. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

@misc{Boulard1995,
abstract = {Several models of air exchange in a greenhouse are derived considering the two main driving forces of natural ventilation (stack effect and wind effect) and compared with experimental results presented in a previous paper. The coupling mechanisms between the "stack" and "wind" effects have been studied and the nature of the wind effect is discussed with reference to the turbulent and average hypothesis already presented in the literature. Two main model parameters were identified by fitting models to experimental values, namely, a coefficient of pressure drop through the vents, Al, whose value is in accord with the other values found in the literature for greenhouse vents or other types of opening, and a coefficient of wind effect, Cw, which integrates both steady and turbulent aspects of wind action. The models are presented and the magnitude of the main driving forces discussed in relation to climatic parameters and characteristics of the ventilation systems. A linear dependence is found between the surface of the vent opening and the wind speed on one hand and the ventilation rate on the other. Nevertheless, analysis of ventilation rate versus wind speed for different classes of wind shows that the wind dependence is not exactly linear because the slope of the linear regression of the ventilation flux versus the wind speed decreases slightly with increasing wind speed. Finally, it is shown that in our experimental conditions, characterized by roof vents all facing the same direction, the wind is the main driving force of ventilation and the air exchange rate seems mainly dependent on the wind turbulence. {\textcopyright} 1995 Silsoe Research Institute.},

@article{Martinez-Ruiz2019,
abstract = {The HortSyst model is a new discrete time model for describing the dynamics of photo-thermal time (PTI), total dry matter production (DMP), N uptake (N up ), leaf area index (LAI), and evapotranspiration (ET c ) for greenhouse crops. The first three variables are considered as state variables and the latter two are conceptualized as output variables. This model was developed as a tool for decision support systems in Mexican greenhouses for the application of N and water in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) production. The HortSyst has 13 parameters. It was used to calibrate the model and estimate the correct parameter values for the crop season. An experiment was carried out to test model predictions in a greenhouse during the autumn-winter season in Chapingo, Mexico. Tomato ‘CID F1' was grown in a hydroponic system and plants were distributed with a density of 3.5 plants m -2 . The tomato crop was transplanted on 21 August 2015. A weather station was installed inside the greenhouse to measure temperature, relative humidity, and global radiation. The HortSyst model provides an excellent predictive quality for DMP, N up , LAI, and ET c according to the statistics. Values for bias (BIAS) were DMP (-3.897), N up (-0.071), LAI (0.026), and ET c (3.647), values for root mean square error (RMSE) were DMP (14.543), N up (0.500), LAI (0.100), and ET c (39.330), and values for modeling efficiency (EF)were DMP (0.996), N up (0.991), LAI (0.998), and ET c (0.815). The model proposed and described in this paper can be integrated as a decision support tool for N supply and irrigation management in greenhouse production systems.},
